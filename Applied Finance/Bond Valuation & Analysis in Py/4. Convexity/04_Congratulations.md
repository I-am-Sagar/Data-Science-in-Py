Congratulations for making it to the end of the course! Let's review what we have covered.

2. **Chapter 1 summary - time value of money**
In chapter one, we covered the time value of money. We looked at simple and compound interest, the concept of future value and how to use the fv function in numpy financial, different compounding frequencies, and some other useful financial functions.

3. **Chapter 2 summary - bond prices and yields**
In chapter two, we began to look at bonds, starting with the concept of present value and the pv function, before examining zero coupon bonds, coupon paying bonds, and the relationship between prices and yields.

4. **Chapter 3 summary - duration**
In chapter three, we introduced the idea of duration as a way of measuring interest rate risk, before looking at the factors affecting duration, dollar duration, and DV01, creating a duration neutral portfolio, and using duration to predict bond prices.

5. **Chapter 4 summary - convexity**
Finally, in chapter four, we introduced convexity and investigated some of the factors affecting the convexity of a bond. We then looked at dollar convexity and the convexity adjustment and combined convexity with duration to improve our estimates of bond price changes.
