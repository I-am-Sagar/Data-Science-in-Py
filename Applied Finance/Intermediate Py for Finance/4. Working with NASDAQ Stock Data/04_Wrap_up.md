In Chapter 2 you learned how to use operators to compare values, check for equality, and perform Boolean operations. Then you learned to use these operators to control the flow of code execution using if statements and loops.

4. **Chapter 3**
In Chapter 3 we introduced the Pandas DataFrame, one of the most important data structures for analyzing data, both financial and otherwise. You learned how to create DataFrames, how to access data, how to aggregate and summarize data, and how to extend and manipulate a DataFrame.

5. **Chapter 4**
And finally in Chapter 4, you've learned good first steps to take with new data by peeking at it. Then you learned how to filter data using comparisons to find the rows that fit your specification. Lastly, you learned how visualize your data by plotting it.

6. **Congratulations!**
You've covered a lot in this course. You now have the tools you need to start analyzing financial data, weather it's historical market trends, or a particular stocks current performance. Congratulations to you and good luck with your new skills!
