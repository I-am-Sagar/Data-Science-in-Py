In Chapter 2, you learned about the financial ratios from the income statement and balance sheet. You also learned how to reduce repetitive work by using user-defined functions and visualize ratios for within company analysis.

Finally, Chapter 4 was all about profitability. You learned about profitability metrics, what drives the differences in ratios between different industries and you also learned many methods of visualization to analyze a company's profitability.

6. Recommended courses for the future
Now that you know about financial statements, you can build upon this knowledge! Courses on data science will help you gain cool skills like predicting the profitability of companies and even their share prices! Courses on PowerBI, a very powerful visualization tool, will build upon your newly gained visualization skills and further improve them. Unlike plots with Seaborn, where the image is static, images with PowerBI can also be made interactive, which is invaluable in business presentations!

7. **Let's practice!**
No more practice now. ;) :P
