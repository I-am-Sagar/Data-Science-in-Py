1. **Dependencies and sensitivity in financial forecasting**
Let's now have a look at dependencies and sensitivities in a forecast.

2. **Explaining forecasting dependencies and sensitivities**
Unlike assumptions, which are set variables that drive best guess estimates, dependencies and sensitivities are interlinked variables, where change in one variable impacts another, to a greater or lesser degree.

3. **Working with dependencies and sensitivities in Python**
In Python, we can use the following structure for our code. Basically, we can create an if statement that can be used to calculate the result depending on if the conditions are met. Look at this example. During the month of December, we expect to have rush orders for the holidays, pushing up delivery costs by 10%. Assume the variables have been defined, then the code would look as follows:

4. **Let's practice!**
Time to put this into practice.
